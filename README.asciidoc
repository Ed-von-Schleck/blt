The BLT library implements http://cr.yp.to/critbit.html[crit-bit trees].
After seeing https://github.com/agl/critbit[Adam Langley's library], I was
inspired to rewrite my old crit-bit tree code.

I highly recommend linking with https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/[tcmalloc].

I'm hoping to find time to add support for trees where each key is the same
length, and also trees where the keys can contain zero bytes, at which point I
can replace my old library in various pet projects.

See blt.h for usage.
